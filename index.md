# 🌟 sorting-algorithms-comparison - Explore Sorting Algorithms Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project shows how popular sorting algorithms work. You can see QuickSort, MergeSort, and RadixSort in action. This guide will help you download and run the software smoothly.

## 📥 Download the Application

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/abcdethatshowyoustartthealphabet/sorting-algorithms-comparison/releases)

## 📝 Features

- Easy to use application
- Visual comparisons of sorting algorithms
- Performance testing on random datasets
- Built with Java for compatibility across many systems
- Understand how different algorithms perform with data

## 💻 Requirements

To run this application, you need:

- A computer with Java (version 8 or higher) installed
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Internet connection for downloading the application

## 📦 Download & Install

To get the software, visit the Releases page:

[Visit this page to download](https://github.com/abcdethatshowyoustartthealphabet/sorting-algorithms-comparison/releases)

1. Click on the link above.
2. Find the latest version listed on the page.
3. Look for a file that ends in `.jar` (this is the application file).
4. Download this file by clicking on it.
5. Once the download completes, locate the file on your computer.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

1. Ensure you have Java installed. You can check this by opening a command prompt and typing `java -version`. If you see a Java version listed, you're ready to go.
2. Open your command prompt or terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the `.jar` file. Use the `cd` command to change directories.
4. Run the application by typing the command:

   ```
   java -jar name_of_the_file.jar
   ```

   Replace `name_of_the_file.jar` with the actual name of the downloaded file.

## 📊 Using the Application

After you run the application, you will see a simple interface. Here's how to use it:

1. **Select an Algorithm:** Choose between QuickSort, MergeSort, and RadixSort.
2. **Input Data:** You may enter a list of numbers or use the default random dataset.
3. **Start Sorting:** Click the "Sort" button. The application will sort the numbers and display the algorithm's performance.
4. **Compare Results:** View the output to see how fast each algorithm sorted the data.

## 🔍 Understanding Algorithms

### QuickSort

QuickSort is a fast sorting method that works by dividing a large dataset into smaller parts. It chooses a "pivot" and sorts numbers around it, which often leads to quicker results.

### MergeSort

MergeSort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm. It divides the dataset into halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them back together. It's great for large datasets.

### RadixSort

RadixSort works a bit differently. It sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit. It can be very fast, especially for sorting large sets of integers.

## 📊 Comparing Performance

The application tests each algorithm's speed on the same dataset. This allows you to see which algorithm performs best based on time taken and efficiency.
